# World-cup-Football-Analysis-1930-2014-
What do you know about world cup so far? sorry, the first question should be, are you a football fanatic? If yes, then this is for you

All analysis was done using Microsoft Power BI.

The major work apart from the dashboard visualization includes the usage of the Dax Functions in creating measures.

Good, all the countries who made it to the semi-finals and finals where known from this analysis, including the goal ratio and the rest.

I have attached a PDF document which is an extract from the visualization dashboard.

The various images as well have been extracted from the dashboard.

You can download and view the report if you have a powerbi desktop or online sevice support.
